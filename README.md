# A Walking Tour of PhantomJS

A brief overview of PhantomJS. Emphasizes the other things that have integration
points with it (e.g., CasperJS, Selenium) and then highlights what has become
its _de facto_ use-case: headless and/or automated unit testing.

There's a little code in it taken and/or adapted from the examples provided in
[the sample code](https://github.com/founddrama/phantomjs-cookbook) for my book,
_[The PhantomJS Cookbook](http://goo.gl/NJnFq1)_.
